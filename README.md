Hello once again. Here's my story and I'll add some in future. I'm from a family with total salary of 2-2,5k$ per year, depends on how long my father has stayed
onboard a ship. Yes, he's a seafarer. So i'd got 2 ways of how my life will go. 1 - is to risk it all and apply to a Math/Coding University in my city (Vladivostok 
city, Russia) and it would take all my family's money OR 2nd one - not to risk, join marine University and get enough money for me and my family to be able to create 
a comfy atmosphere, make a necessary medical treatment to parents and etc and only after this continue with my dream to become a developer. So now, i'd graduated 
from marine university in Russia. I don't have to worry about what to eat, where to live and how to trat my family anymore and i'm full of enthusiasm to become a 
Web-Developer. I've started my solo-learning with a books, YouTube videos and CodeWars:) Now I have to finish some coursera courses. See ya later !>---
